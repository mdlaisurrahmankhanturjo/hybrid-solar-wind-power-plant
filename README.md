## 📖 Overview
This project presents the **design and optimization** of a **hybrid renewable energy system** integrating **solar photovoltaic (PV)** and **wind energy** sources.  
Using **HOMER software**, the system was modeled to achieve **optimal sizing, maximum energy yield, and cost efficiency** based on real‑world wind and solar atlas data.

Key features:
- **Hybrid generation**: Solar PV + wind turbines for continuous power supply
- **Data‑driven optimization** using HOMER
- **Cost analysis** for Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) and Net Present Cost (NPC)
- **Scalable design** for rural electrification or grid‑connected systems
